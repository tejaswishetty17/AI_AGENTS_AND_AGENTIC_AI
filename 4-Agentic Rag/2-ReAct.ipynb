      " ### Agent Loop\n",
      "An agent loop refers to the process in which an agent continually learns and improves its performance over time. This involves feeding the history of its learning experiences back into its model, leading to better predictions and actions in future trials. For example, in the context of large language models (LLMs), such as those used in scientific discovery tasks, the agent can utilize various tools, including internet browsing, documentation reading, code execution, and robotics experimentation APIs. There are several proof-of-concept applications that demonstrate agents powered by LLMs, showcasing their potential as powerful general problem solvers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Autonomous Agents\n",
      "According to Wikipedia, an **autonomous agent** is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that operates independently to perform complex tasks. These agents are a subset of intelligent agents, which perceive their environment and act autonomously to achieve goals. They may also improve their performance over time through machine learning or knowledge acquisition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intelligent agents can range in complexity from simple systems, like a thermostat, to highly advanced entities, such as humans or organizations. They are designed based on an objective function that encapsulates their goals, allowing them to create and execute plans to maximize expected outcomes. This framework intertwines with cognitive science, economics, ethics, and other fields, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of autonomous agents and intelligent systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, both concepts point to the growing capabilities and applications of AI in executing and improving complex tasks autonomously.\n"

      "✅ Final Answer:\n",
      " The internal research notes on transformer variants provide several insights:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **EfficientFormer**: \n",
      "   - Achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 92.4% on TinyImageNet.\n",
      "   - Peak memory usage is 290MB with a batch size of 16.\n",
      "   - Successfully deployed on Raspberry Pi 4.\n",
      "   - Demonstrated effectiveness in quantized int8 mode with no significant accuracy drop.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Longformer**: \n",
      "   - Evaluated on customer support logs with a maximum token limit of 8192.\n",
      "   - Noted a latency of over 1.2 seconds per query in a streaming setting.\n",
      "   - Observations suggest that chunk-based hybrid attention could help reduce delays.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Reformer**: \n",
      "   - Encountered challenges during training, including bucket collisions and inconsistent loss spikes.\n",
      "   - Sparse gradient updates were observed during LSH attention.\n",
      "   - Various solutions were attempted, including gradient clipping and the use of memory-efficient attention modules.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **TinyBERT**: \n",
      "   - Used for classifying support ticket priority, achieving an 87% F1 score.\n",
      "   - Confusion noted within ambiguous classes, particularly Class C.\n",
      "   - Performed well with a 2-layer feedforward neural network (FFN) adapter for domain transfer.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Additional Experiments**:\n",
      "   - Implemented FlashAttention2 into LLaMA2, reducing context latency by about 50%.\n",
      "   - Found that Chain-of-Thought prompting outperformed direct answer prompting by 8% on logic tasks.\n",
      "   - Conducted hybrid retrieval experiments comparing Weaviate with FAISS + BM25 reranking, noting that FAISS was more efficient but had slightly lower recall.\n",
      "   - LoRA tuning was applied for adapter-based fine-tuning, significantly reducing GPU memory footprint by 60%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, there was an issue in retrieving recent papers from ArXiv about transformer variants. I can try to run that search again if you would like.\n"
