      " ### Agent Loop\n",
      "\n",
      "An *agent loop* refers to a process in which an agent learns from its interactions and progressively improves its performance over time. In this context, it involves using past experiences and feedback to refine predictions and actions. For example, in a reinforcement learning scenario, an agent may explore various actions, and based on the outcomes, it adjusts its behavior to enhance future performance. This concept is explored in various spaces, including large language models (LLMs) that can autonomously conduct tasks, such as scientific experiments or problem-solving.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Autonomous Agents\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Wikipedia, an *autonomous agent* is an artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of performing complex tasks independently. It perceives its environment, takes actions toward achieving its goals, and may enhance its performance through machine learning or knowledge acquisition.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Intelligent Agents**: This broader category includes any entity that acts autonomously to reach its objectives, ranging from simple systems like thermostats to complex beings like humans. Intelligent agents operate based on an objective function, which defines their goals and guides their planning and actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Agentic AI**: A subset of intelligent agents that actively pursues goals over extended periods. These agents make decisions, pursue goals, and adapt based on previous experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the study of intelligent agents encompasses various fields like cognitive science, economics, ethics, and more, illustrating its interdisciplinary nature and implications.\n"
